## Player List Management

### Local Storage (default)
- Add players from **Manage Players**.
- Player names are stored in browser local storage.
- Export/import JSON to back up or move between devices.

- an array of names, or
- an object with a `players` array.

When auto-sync is enabled, player updates are fetched on app load.

#### Example GitHub raw URL
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rickytann14/Oh-Hell/main/oh-hell-players.json`

  "exportDate": "2026-02-12T00:00:00.000Z",

}

## Game Flow

### Round setup
For each round, enter:
- **Hand Size** (starts from your game setup value, then adjustable each round)
- **Trump (Big Boss)** rank + suit
- Player **Bid**, **Tax**, **Confidence**, **Deferred**, and **Got Set**

### Validation before scoring
- **Exact bids are invalid**: total bids cannot equal hand size.
- At least one player must be marked **Got Set**.

### After scoring a round
- **↩️ Undo Round** reverses that round’s score impact.
- **➡️ Next Round** starts the next round.
- **🏁 End Game** shows final rankings.

## Scoring Rules

### If player got set
`score = -confidence - deferredPenalty - tax`

### If player made bid and bid > 0
`score = 10 + (bid × bid) + confidence - deferredPenalty - tax`

### If player made zero bid
`score = zeroBonus + handSize + confidence - deferredPenalty - tax`

### Modifiers
- **Confidence**: `MAX`, `10`, `5`, `0`
  - `MAX` = 10 for positive bids, 5 for zero bids
- **Deferred penalty**: 2 points when deferred is checked
- **Tax**: custom penalty subtracted from score
- **Zero bonus**:
  - 10 points when player count is 6 or fewer
  - 5 points when player count is 7 or more

## Editing History

Use **✏️ Edit** in **Score History** to modify any scored round:
- hand size
- bids/tax/confidence
- deferred / got set flags

Saving edits recalculates that round and updates overall standings.
